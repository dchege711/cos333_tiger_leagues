# Feature Requests for Tiger Leagues

* You should add a feature to upload and share pictures and videos of the match to brag.
* We can have a puskas award (most beautiful goal) for the league at the end of the tourney
* You should have a leaderboard
* In-depth stats, highlights, something to track playoff probability/scenarios toward the end would be pretty cool.
* Also a schedule for all the games.
* We can watch other pplâ€™s matches right? Would be cool to have an audience
